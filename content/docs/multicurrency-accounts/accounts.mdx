## Real Accounts

A multicurrency account is a real account held with ClearBank and can be used to send and/or receive payments. The balance of a multicurrency account is also held by ClearBank.

You can use a multicurrency account to hold multiple non-GBP currency balances under the same IBAN, which can be specified at the time of creating the account via our API. Prior to assigning your desired IBAN to the account, we will validate it to ensure that the IBAN format is acceptable and not already in use.

At this time, you cannot open or hold GBP balances in a multicurrency account. GBP payments to and from a multicurrency account are not currently allowed either and would be rejected as well as returned automatically.

If you already hold a GBP account with ClearBank, your new multicurrency account will be opened under a sort code that is different to the one associated with your existing GBP account. ClearBank will set up the non-GBP currency sort code for you as part of onboarding.

For more information about currencies supported by ClearBank Multicurrency accounts, please speak to your Relationship Manager.
