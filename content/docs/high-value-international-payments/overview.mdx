## Overview

You can now send single or bulk high value payments overseas in currencies other than GBP. To be able to initiate high value international payments, we will need you to first fund your SIM account  while integrating with our API in the simulation environment. As part of our fund assessment control framework, you will not be able to initiate high value international payments without doing so.

ClearBank accepts inbound and outbound Euro payments via the TARGET2 scheme only. Inbound payments which are processed via any other scheme apart from TARGET2 will not be accepted by ClearBank. Non-EUR high value international payments are settled according to cut-off times specific to the currency in which the payment is made.

For more information about the countries that you can send high value payments to, currencies supported by ClearBank and currency cut-off times, please speak to your Relationship Manager.
