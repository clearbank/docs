## CoP Send (Outbound)

Sending a CoP request to an external participant requires us to pass the request to the participant so that they can complete a fuzzy matching check on the account in question. 
To be able to send a CoP (Outbound) request to an external participant, you will need to use the following POST endpoint so that the exact name registered with the payee’s account can be confirmed:
- POST /open-banking/outbound/v1/name-verification

Once confirmed, we pass the result of the matching check back to you which you can then expose to your customer. Pay.UK have provided a messaging standard for you to follow. Further information about the messaging standard along with your responsibilities can be found in our Confirmation of Payee (CoP) Operating Guide. This document can be found in the Reference Documents section in the Knowledge Centre.
